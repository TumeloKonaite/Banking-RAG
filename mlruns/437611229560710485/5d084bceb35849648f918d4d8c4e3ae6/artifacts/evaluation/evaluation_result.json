  "question": "What are the monthly service fees for the everyday current account?",
  "reference_answer": "The everyday current account charges a single monthly service fee that covers standard transactions and digital banking access.",
  "generated_answer": "The documents do not specify the exact monthly service fees for the everyday current account. They mention that fees are set out in the pricing guide, which can be obtained from the bank's website or branches. I recommend checking the latest pricing guide for detailed fee information.",

  "feedback": "The answer correctly states that the documents do not specify exact fees and suggests checking the pricing guide, which is a reasonable response given the lack of specific info. However, it does not mention that the fee covers standard transactions and digital banking access, as indicated in the reference answer. Overall, it addresses the question but misses some details about what the fee covers.",
